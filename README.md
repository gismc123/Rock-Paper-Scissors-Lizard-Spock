# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game (Go)

Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock** game implemented in Go! This is a command-line game where you play against the computer (bot). The first to reach 5 wins is the overall winner.

This game is inspired by the popular variation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, made famous by *The Big Bang Theory* TV show, adding two more choices â€” Lizard and Spock â€” to reduce ties and increase fun.
